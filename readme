# Hebcal Zmanim Telegram Bot

## Overview

This Python script is a Telegram bot that provides Zmanim (Jewish prayer times) information based on the user's location. The bot uses the Hebcal API to fetch accurate prayer times and sends a detailed response to location messages.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Install the required Python packages using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install pyrogram requests
     ```

3. **Telegram API Token:**
   - Create a new Telegram bot on [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).
   - Obtain the API token for your bot.


4. **Initialize and Verify Session:**
   - The script utilizes [Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) for interacting with the Telegram API.
   - Upon running the script, Pyrogram handles the initialization and session verification, creating a `my_account` file containing the bot's session details.

5. **Running the Bot:**
   - Execute the script in a Python environment.
     ```bash
     python your_script_name.py
     ```

## Bot Commands

## Note

- The Zmanim information is obtained from [Hebcal](https://www.hebcal.com), and the bot relies on Hebcal's data.
